VERSION 1.21
    
DESCRIPTION - This program takes the quality filtered, demultiplexed, and adapter trimmed *.fastq input files (unpadded) and reference genome fasta input files as input. Converts the reference genome fasta file to BWA input format by renumerating the fasta headers and generates a table of contents file referencing the sequence headers to the new BWA input format sequence headers. It then performs a BWA alignment to align the GBS fastq sequences to the reference genome. It then executes the pstacks program, which extracts sequence stacks that were aligned to the reference genome using the BWA alignment program and identifies SNPs. These sequence stacks are then processed using cstacks and sstacks to obtain the filtered SNP stacks output files.
