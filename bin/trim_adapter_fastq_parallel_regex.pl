DESCRIPTION - A program to trim the GBS common adapter sequence from each GBS fastq file within a particular Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) project. Fixes the misprimming issue where the GBS common adapter is sequenced along with the DNA of an individual

OPTIONS:

-i fastq_file_dir - The *.fastq input file directory that contains files with the extension .fastq for each individual within the Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) project.
	e.g. /path/to/fastq_file_dir
	
-p project_name - The name of the Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) project, which is used to generate the output directories and files with the specifed output directory.
	e.g. MPB_MALE_GBS
	
-r restriction_enzymes - The restriction enzyme(s) used to digest the genomic sequences. Default: Pstl/MspI

-l gbs_sequence_length - The GBS fastq sequence length in base pairs (bps) common to all GBS fastq sequences. Default: 92

-m adapter_length_min_threshold - The minimum GBS common adapter sequence length cut-off in base pairs (bps) to retain for trimming if found in a given GBS fastq sequence hit found in the adapter regex searches. Default: 16

-t adapter_trim_offset - The trimming offset length in base pairs (bps) to trim upstream of the start of the GBS common adapter sequence found in the adapter regex searches. Default: 5

-q min_trimmed_fastq_sequence_length - The minimum trimmed fastq sequence length in base pairs (bps) to retain after trimming. Keep in mind that this is the minimum trimmed fastq sequence length used before we add the 
length of the barcode used for splitting each individual fastq file. Tassel requires sequences at least 32 base pairs (bps) plus the length of a particular barcode that can be in the range of 4-8 base pairs (bps) in 
length. Default: 32

-n pad_sequences - The padded sequence controller. Default: true

-c regex_num_cpu - The number of cpu cores to use for the adapter regex searches. You should choose a number so that this parameter is at most the total number of cpu cores on your system minus 1. Default: 2

-o output_dir - The absolute path to the output directory to contain the trimmed adapter sequence fastq output files.

	e.g. /path/to/output_dir
