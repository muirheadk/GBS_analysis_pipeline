#### PROGRAM NAME ####
# execute_multi_fastq_barcode_splitter.pl - A program that performs a quality assessment and quality control filtering step to filter out GBS fastq reads that do not meet the quality threshold given in the quality scores. It also demultiplexes the original raw bulk GBS fastq file based on barcode into separate samples that include the barcode in the filename. The quality filtering and quality threshold steps are performed using the process_radtags program in the STACKS software suite. Once the raw fastq file is demultiplexed by barcode the resulting files are renamed corresponding to the individual name, plate/well number, and barcode sequence and copied to the corresponding project leader directory.

inline_index: barcode is inline with sequence on single-end read, occurs in FASTQ header for paired-end read.
index_inline: barcode occurs in FASTQ header for single-end read, is inline with sequence on paired-end read.
