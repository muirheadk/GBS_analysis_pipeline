DESCRIPTION - This program generates barcode input files for input into the Stacks fastq_quality_barcode_splitter.pl script. Takes a GBS shipment file and barcode legend file as input. Generates a barcode file for each GBS plate listed in the GBS shipment file.

OPTIONS:

-i GBS_shipment_infile - The GBS shipment file in tab-delimited format (i.e. GBS_Shipment_GQ03122013_5.txt)

	e.g. /path/to/GBS_Shipment_GQ03122013_5.txt

-l barcodes_legend_infile - The barcodes legend file in tab-delimited format (i.e. PstI_MspI_barcodes_legend.txt)

	e.g. /path/to/PstI_MspI_barcodes_legend.txt

-o barcodes_output_dir - The absolute path to the output directory to contain the barcodes output files

	e.g. /path/to/barcodes_output_dir

USAGE
