#### PROGRAM NAME ####
# grab_catalog_loci.pl - Program that generates a reference genome fasta file filtered to only contain sequences that contain SNPs generated from the refgen_stacks_analysis_pipeline.pl and populations_stacks.pl scripts. Requires a reference genome that was formatted by the refgen_stacks_analysis_pipeline.pl script so that we can grab the SNPs by the reference sequence ID found in the populations Stacks write_single_snp fasta formatted input file. You can also use a whitelist of locus ids to get only the reference genome scaffolds that pass the present data filter in convert_fasta2nexus.pl. Also prints out the populations fasta sequences that passed the present data filter to an output file.
